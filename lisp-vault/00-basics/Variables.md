In Common Lisp, a variable is a symbolic name associated with a value; it serves as a fundamental building block in the constructions of Lisp programs. Variables in Lisp are not just  placeholders for data values, but they are also central to the language's powerful features such as dynamic scoping, lexical scoping, and first-class functions.
